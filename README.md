# Welcome
Welcome to the DCC guides! Here we try to address common issues related to Research Software, Data and Infrastructure at TU Delft. These guides are undergoing continuous development in response to the community needs.

This repository also has a [**Discussions**](https://github.com/TU-Delft-DCC/TU-Delft-DCC.github.io/discussions) "backend" where we try to address not only answers to problems, but also share ideas, questions, comments, or simply get an overview of hot topics we are discussing.

## What are these guides?
The guides are under active development and mainly in use as a useful resource for the support provided by the DCC. The content is a compilation of developed solutions, relevant links and resources, and documents produced by colleagues inside and outside TU Delft. This is not an official TU Delft website, but rather a place where we keep note of things we find important and useful to share.
